1. PROMPT

I need you to make me a prefect prompt for vibecoding this jupyter notebook project. These are the deliverables 
Deliverables
For this assignment, we expect you to deliver a .zip container containing the following:
-	A report of your process, explanations and insights
-	A notebook with code for the relevant elements youâ€™ve described in the report
-	Data (if youâ€™ve created any new data, make sure this is mentioned in the report)
In addition to a front page, contents page, and introduction, the report contains at least the following information/chapters:
1.	Description of the data. Where does the data come from, what does it reflect?
1.	Draw the Directed Acyclic Graph of the independent variables in the data, and how they lead to the dependent variable you would like to see. 
2.	Describe what the column names are, what kind of data each column contains, what does each variable mean, which variables are dependent and independent. 
3.	Describe the data, as far as possible, using descriptive statistics. 
4.	Describe the correlation matrix and explain the correlation coefficients. Explain which variables are meaningful to use for the predictive modelling.
5.	Visualise the data in a useful way; try to capture relevant patterns
6.	If applicable: visualise the data as a time series (e.g. day/hour/week in combination with the dependent variable).

2.	Pipeline of predictive modelling.
1.	Define the features to use for your prediction, and the outcome variable, given the data.
2.	Prepare the data so that it can be used for model fitting.
3.	Make use of additional data sources to explain patterns.
4.	Add the notebook of the algorithms used (e.g. Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Regression, K-means Clustering, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes). 
5.	Display the performance of the algorithms with appropriate metrics (e.g. using R2, RMSE, a Confusion Matrix and F1-score, or AUC-ROC) and discuss what the metric tells you. 
6.	Argue why certain algorithms were used and what the arguments are for the best model.

3.	Conclusion
State your conclusions and explain what can be learnt from this data. 

But i just need the code for the jyputer notebook my partner is making the report.

in the first foto the are also a different description of the project. But focus on the better described variables. Do you need anything else for the generation of the prompt?

RESULT OF PROMPT 1.

Here’s a ready-to-paste “vibecoding” prompt for your Jupyter project.
You can give this as the first message to ChatGPT / Copilot inside the notebook.
Just replace things in ALL CAPS with your own details (dataset path, topic, etc.).

You are an expert data scientist and Python developer working with me in ONE Jupyter notebook.

Goal
- Help me build all the CODE for a full data-science pipeline on my dataset, according to the assignment below.
- Focus on clean, well-structured Python code + short Markdown notes ONLY. 
- DO NOT write the separate report for school – only brief explanations inside the notebook so my teammate can use them.

Context of the assignment
- I must hand in:
  1) A Jupyter notebook with all relevant code and results.
  2) A written report (which someone else will write based on this notebook).
  3) A prompt log (list of prompts I used and what they produced).
- The project description:
  - Describe and explore the data.
  - Draw and explain a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) showing how the independent variables lead to the dependent variable.
  - Do descriptive statistics and correlations, with visualisations.
  - If applicable, visualise the data as a time series.
  - Build a predictive modelling pipeline:
    * Define features and outcome.
    * Prepare data.
    * Optionally use additional data sources.
    * Train several algorithms (e.g. Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Regression, K-means, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).
    * Evaluate with suitable metrics (R², RMSE, confusion matrix, F1, ROC-AUC, etc.).
    * Compare models and argue which is best.
  - Finish with short conclusions about what can be learned from this data (inside notebook as Markdown).

My specific project details
- Data file location: `PATH/TO/MY_FILE.csv`
- Brief description of what the data is about: `SHORT DESCRIPTION OF DATA SOURCE`
- Dependent / target variable: `TARGET_COLUMN_NAME`
- Important independent variables I expect to matter: `LIST_OF_KEY_FEATURES`
- Whether there is a time component (yes/no, and if yes, which column is the timestamp): `TIME_COLUMN_NAME_OR_NONE`

Global style rules for your answers
1. Always answer as a sequence of clearly separated Jupyter cells, labeled like:
   - "Markdown cell:" followed by the Markdown content.
   - "Code cell:" followed by Python code.
2. Code must be directly runnable, using:
   - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
   - scikit-learn (sklearn)
   - and, if needed, networkx or graphviz for the DAG.
   If extra libraries are needed, first give a separate Code cell with the `pip install` command.
3. Keep explanations short, practical and non-academic. Bullet points are perfect.
4. Prefer readability over clever tricks. Use clear variable names and comments.
5. Use `random_state=42` (or similar) wherever randomness is involved.
6. Never print entire huge DataFrames – show `head()`, `info()`, shapes, and selected summaries instead.
7. Every time you respond, ALSO give me a short “Prompt-log entry” at the end:
   - Format: `Prompt-log entry: "<very short description of what we just did>"`.
   - I will copy these into my separate prompt log document.

Concrete steps I want you to implement in the notebook

A) Setup and loading
1. Create cells to:
   - Import all required libraries.
   - Load the CSV from `PATH/TO/MY_FILE.csv` into a DataFrame.
   - Show basic info: shape, `df.head()`, `df.info()`, missing values per column.

B) Data description & understanding
2. Add Markdown + code cells that:
   - Summarise in bullets what the dataset represents and what the target variable is.
   - Create a neat table with: column name, dtype, number of unique values, number of missing values.
   - Mark each column as “candidate feature”, “target”, or “drop” based on the project description (you can suggest this and I’ll adjust).

C) Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
3. Using your best judgment and my feature list, construct a plausible DAG:
   - Either with `networkx` (preferred) plus a matplotlib drawing,
   - OR (if libraries are limited) as a clear adjacency list / Markdown diagram.
   - Include a short Markdown explanation of the assumed causal structure.

D) Descriptive statistics and correlations
4. Add code and plots to:
   - Compute descriptive stats for numeric columns (`describe()`) and relevant summaries for categoricals.
   - Plot distributions (histograms, KDEs) for key numeric variables.
   - Plot bar charts for important categorical variables.
   - Compute a correlation matrix for numeric features and show it as a heatmap.
   - Briefly explain which variables look promising or strongly correlated with the target.

E) Visualisation of patterns and, if applicable, time series
5. Create visualisations that:
   - Show relationships between top features and the target (e.g. boxplots, scatter plots, grouped bar plots).
   - If a time column is available:
     * Convert to datetime.
     * Create a time series plot of the target over time (daily/weekly as appropriate).
     * Optionally show seasonal/weekly patterns if those make sense.

F) Modelling pipeline
6. Build a clean scikit-learn pipeline:
   - Identify numeric and categorical feature columns.
   - Handle missing values (e.g. SimpleImputer).
   - Scale numeric features and one-hot encode categoricals via `ColumnTransformer`.
   - Split into train/test sets.
   - Automatically decide whether this is a classification or regression problem based on the type of the target variable (or I will tell you).

7. Train multiple models appropriate for the problem type, for example:
   - If CLASSIFICATION:
     * Logistic Regression
     * Decision Tree Classifier
     * Random Forest Classifier
     * Naive Bayes
   - If REGRESSION:
     * Linear Regression / Ridge
     * Decision Tree Regressor
     * Random Forest Regressor
     * (Optionally) KMeans for unsupervised clustering to explore structure.

8. For each model:
   - Fit on the training data.
   - Predict on the test data.
   - Compute appropriate metrics:
     * Regression: R², RMSE (and optionally MAE).
     * Classification: confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC if the target is binary.
   - Store the metrics in a comparison DataFrame for easy ranking of models.

9. Create visualisations to compare models:
   - Bar plot of key metrics per model.
   - For classification: ROC curves for main models.
   - For regression: scatter plot of predicted vs actual for the best model.

G) Model selection and brief conclusions
10. Add a Markdown cell that:
    - Identifies the best model based on the metrics.
    - Briefly summarises (in bullet points) why this model is preferred.
    - Lists 3–5 short “takeaways” from the data (patterns, important features, time trends, etc.).
    - Keep this concise so my teammate can expand it into the full written report.

Final instructions
- Start by asking me ONLY for any missing key information (e.g. exact CSV path, target column name, whether it’s a classification or regression task).
- Then proceed step by step through the plan above.
- At each step, provide:
  1) The necessary Markdown + code cells.
  2) A one-line `Prompt-log entry` summarising what we just added to the notebook.

Begin now.

If you’d like, I can also tailor this prompt to your exact dataset (column names, target, time column, topic) so you don’t have to edit the placeholders yourself.

2. PROMPT

I want you to fill out the all the exact datasets with the files that i have provided. Kaikki membership tyypit vuodet 2020-2022.csv is a list of all membership types and cardholder data. 
Yhdistetyt_p_iv_t__aikaj_rjestyksess__.csv is a file that contais every special day that has been listed in a academic calender.
Check-in-times_sheet_2017-2021 kaikki checkin timet yhes.csv tells the check in times by cardholder. I have also included a graph of the file structure. so upadate the prompt now

(I Included a picture of the file structure and the data files from our previous aclo project)




RESULTS OF PROMPT 2.

Nice, that helps a lot. Here’s the updated vibecoding prompt with your exact files and structure filled in. You can paste this as your first message to ChatGPT/Copilot inside ACLO_project_AI.ipynb.

You are an expert data scientist and Python developer working with me in ONE Jupyter notebook.

Goal
- Help me build all the CODE for a full data-science pipeline on my datasets, according to the assignment below.
- Focus on clean, well-structured Python code + short Markdown notes ONLY.

    * Evaluate with suitable metrics (R², RMSE, confusion matrix, F1, ROC-AUC, etc.).
    * Compare models and argue which is best.
  - Finish with short conclusions about what can be learned from this data (inside notebook as Markdown).

Project structure and datasets
- Project root: `ACLO_PROJECT_AI/`
- Notebook: `ACLO_project_AI.ipynb`
- All data files are in the subfolder `Data/`:

  1) `Data/Kaikki membership tyypit vuodet 2020-2022.csv`
     - Contains all membership types and cardholder data for years 2020–2022.
     - Think of this as the main “who has what membership” table.

  2) `Data/Yhdistetyt_p_iv_t__aikaj_rjestyksess__.csv`
     - Contains every special day listed in the academic calendar, in chronological order.
     - Each row represents a special day/date with its type/category.

  3) `Data/Check-in-times_sheet_2017-2021 kaikki checkin timet yhes.csv`
     - Contains all check-in times by cardholder for 2017–2021.
     - Each row is a check-in event with at least:
       * some cardholder identifier
       * a timestamp/date of the check-in
       * possibly other attributes (location, etc.)

High-level intention for combining data
- We want to analyse how:
  - membership type and cardholder characteristics
  - calendar special days
  - and time patterns
  relate to check-in behaviour.
- So the notebook should:
  - Load all three datasets.
  - Clean and standardise keys (e.g. cardholder ID, date columns).
  - Merge membership info with check-in data on cardholder ID.
  - Enrich check-ins with special-day information using the date.
  - From this combined dataset, define a target variable that we want to predict (for example: “will this member check in at least X times in a given period” or something similar, to be clarified with me).

Important: I will tell you the exact TARGET variable once we’ve inspected the data a bit.
Assume for now that:
- There is a time component (check-in timestamps; special-day dates).
- The task will probably be a CLASSIFICATION problem (e.g. high vs low activity), but you must confirm with me after the initial exploration.

Global style rules for your answers
1. Always answer as a sequence of clearly separated Jupyter cells, labeled like:
   - "Markdown cell:" followed by the Markdown content.
   - "Code cell:" followed by Python code.
2. Code must be directly runnable, using:
   - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
   - scikit-learn (sklearn)
   - and, if needed, networkx or graphviz for the DAG.
   If extra libraries are needed, first give a separate Code cell with the `pip install` command.
3. Keep explanations short, practical and non-academic. Bullet points are perfect.
4. Prefer readability over clever tricks. Use clear variable names and comments.
5. Use `random_state=42` (or similar) wherever randomness is involved.
6. Never print entire huge DataFrames – show `head()`, `info()`, shapes, and selected summaries instead.
7. Every time you respond, ALSO give me a short “Prompt-log entry” at the end:
   - Format: `Prompt-log entry: "<very short description of what we just did>"`.
   - I will copy these into my separate prompt log document.

Concrete steps I want you to implement in the notebook

A) Setup and loading
1. Create cells to:
   - Import all required libraries.
   - Load the three CSVs:

     * `Data/Kaikki membership tyypit vuodet 2020-2022.csv`
     * `Data/Yhdistetyt_p_iv_t__aikaj_rjestyksess__.csv`
     * `Data/Check-in-times_sheet_2017-2021 kaikki checkin timet yhes.csv`

   - Show basic info for each: shape, `head()`, `info()`, missing values per column, and sensible previews.

B) Data description & understanding
2. Add Markdown + code cells that:
   - Summarise in bullets what each dataset represents.
   - For each dataset, create a neat table with: column name, dtype, number of unique values, number of missing values.
   - Propose how each dataset will be used:
     * membership: descriptive features about cardholders.
     * check-ins: behaviour over time.
     * special days: contextual time-based features.
   - Mark each column as “candidate feature”, “target (to be decided)”, “key for joins”, or “drop”, based on reasonable assumptions (I will adjust).

C) Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
3. Using your best judgment and my feedback, construct a plausible DAG describing:
   - How membership attributes → affect check-in behaviour.
   - How special days and time variables → affect check-ins.
   - Include cardholder-level variables, time-of-year variables, and the eventual target.
   - Implement:
     * A networkx-based DAG visual (or alternative) plus a short Markdown explanation.

D) Descriptive statistics and correlations
4. Add code and plots to:
   - Compute descriptive stats for key numeric columns in each dataset.
   - Summarise categorical variables (membership types, special-day categories, etc.).
   - Plot distributions (histograms/KDEs) for important numeric variables (e.g. number of check-ins per member, per day).
   - Compute correlation matrices on engineered, member-level or period-level features (e.g. total check-ins, average per week, etc.) and show them as heatmaps.
   - Briefly explain which variables look promising or strongly associated with activity.

E) Visualisation of patterns and time series
5. Create visualisations that:
   - Show relationships between membership type and check-in volume.
   - Show how check-ins vary across time (per day, week, month, academic periods).
   - Overlay or compare check-in patterns on normal days vs special days from the calendar file.
   - Convert any date/time columns to proper datetime and, where useful, create:
     * time-of-day
     * day-of-week
     * month/semester
     * “special day vs normal day” flags.
   - Build time series plots of aggregated check-ins (daily/weekly), with optional smoothing.

F) Modelling pipeline
6. Once we define a concrete TARGET variable together (for example: “whether a member reaches at least N check-ins in a period”), build a clean scikit-learn pipeline:
   - Identify numeric and categorical feature columns from the combined dataset.
   - Handle missing values (e.g. SimpleImputer).
   - Scale numeric features and one-hot encode categoricals via `ColumnTransformer`.
   - Split into train/test sets.
   - Confirm whether the task is CLASSIFICATION or REGRESSION based on the target (ask me if unclear).

7. Train multiple models appropriate for the problem type, for example:
   - If CLASSIFICATION:
     * Logistic Regression
     * Decision Tree Classifier
     * Random Forest Classifier
     * Naive Bayes
   - If REGRESSION:
     * Linear Regression / Ridge
     * Decision Tree Regressor
     * Random Forest Regressor
     * (Optionally) KMeans for unsupervised clustering to explore structure in member behaviour.

8. For each model:
   - Fit on the training data.
   - Predict on the test data.
   - Compute appropriate metrics:
     * Regression: R², RMSE (and optionally MAE).
     * Classification: confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC if the target is binary.
   - Store the metrics in a comparison DataFrame for easy ranking of models.

9. Create visualisations to compare models:
   - Bar plot of key metrics per model.
   - For classification: ROC curves for main models.
   - For regression: scatter plot of predicted vs actual for the best model.

G) Model selection and brief conclusions
10. Add a Markdown cell that:
    - Identifies the best model based on the metrics.
    - Briefly summarises (in bullet points) why this model is preferred.
    - Lists 3–5 short “takeaways” from the data (patterns, important features, time trends, effect of special days, etc.).
    - Keep this concise so my teammate can expand it into the full written report.

Final instructions
- Start by:
  1) Loading all three CSV files from the `Data/` folder.
  2) Showing me their basic structure.
  3) Asking me ONLY for any missing key information (especially: the exact TARGET variable and whether we treat this as classification or regression).
- Then proceed step by step through the plan above.
- At each step, provide:
  1) The necessary Markdown + code cells.
  2) A one-line `Prompt-log entry` summarising what we just added to the notebook.

    - Lists 3–5 short “takeaways” from the data (patterns, important features, time trends, effect of special days, etc.).
    - Keep this concise so my teammate can expand it into the full written report.

Final instructions
- Start by:
  1) Loading all three CSV files from the `Data/` folder.
  2) Showing me their basic structure.
  3) Asking me ONLY for any missing key information (especially: the exact TARGET variable and whether we treat this as classification or regression).
- Then proceed step by step through the plan above.
- At each step, provide:
  1) The necessary Markdown + code cells.
  2) A one-line `Prompt-log entry` summarising what we just added to the notebook.

Begin now.


RESULT OF PROMPT 3.

I'll help you build a complete data science pipeline in your Jupyter notebook. 
Let me start by loading the three datasets and showing you their structure, then we'll determine the target variable together.

(THE CODE PART OF THE PROMPT CAN BE FOUND UNDER "FIRST PROMPT" COMMIT IN THIS REPOSITORY)


Summary
I've successfully loaded all three datasets and analyzed their structure:

Datasets Loaded:
Membership Data (32,833 rows): Card numbers, gender, and membership types (2020-2022)
Special Days (164 rows): Academic calendar events like exam weeks, orientation days (2017-2021)
Check-ins (380,785 rows): Individual check-in events with timestamps, affiliation, gender (2017-2021)
Key Observations:
Check-ins dataset has ~380K events from different cardholders over 5 years
Membership dataset has info on ~22K unique cardholders with their membership types
Special days dataset has 164 special academic dates (exams, orientations, etc.)
We can join these datasets on Card Number and enrich with date-based features
🔴 BEFORE I CONTINUE:
Please tell me which TARGET VARIABLE you want to predict:

Option 1 (Classification): "Is this member highly active?" (e.g., ≥20 check-ins per semester = active)

Option 2 (Classification): Activity level in 3 categories (Low/Medium/High)

Option 3 (Regression): Total number of check-ins per member per period

Option 4 (Classification): Will member continue being active next period?

Or suggest your own target!

Once you decide, I'll proceed with:

Data cleaning and feature engineering
Building the DAG
Descriptive statistics and visualizations
The full modeling pipeline
Prompt-log entry: "Loaded three datasets (membership, special days, check-ins), explored structure, identified 380K check-in events, and asked user to define target variable for prediction task."

4. PROMT

can you do both option 3 and option 4

RESULT OF PROMPT 4.

Excellent choice! I'll build two separate predictive models:

Regression Model (Option 3): Predict the total number of check-ins per member
Classification Model (Option 4): Predict if a member will remain active in the next period
This will give you a comprehensive analysis. Let me continue building the full pipeline for both tasks.
